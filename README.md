# Weather Application

This project is a simple weather application that allows users to search for weather information in various cities and view the current weather conditions for those cities. The app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays additional information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions using icons. Users can also view an image of the city, fetched from the Pixabay API, to enhance the visual experience.

## Features
- Search for cities by name to view current weather data
- Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with appropriate icons
- Fetch and display a relevant image of the city from Pixabay
- Add and manage multiple cities with draggable weather cards
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices
